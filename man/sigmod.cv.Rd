\title{Find connected explanatory SNPs.}
\usage{
sigmod.cv(gwas, net, covars = data.frame(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{gwas}{A SnpMatrix object with the GWAS information.}

\item{net}{An igraph network that connects the SNPs.}

\item{covars}{A data frame with the covariates. It must contain a column 
'sample' containing the sample IDs, and an additional columns for each 
covariate.}

\item{score}{Association score to measure association between 
genotype and phenotype. Possible values: chi2 (default), glm.}

\item{criterion}{String with the function to measure the quality of a split. 
Possible values: consistency (default), bic, aic, aicc.}

\item{etas}{Numeric vector with the etas to explore in the grid search. If 
ommited, it's automatically created based on the association
scores.}

\item{lambdas}{Numeric vector with the lambdas to explore in the grid search.
If ommited, it's automatically created based on the association scores.}

\item{c}{Numeric vector with the association scores of the SNPs. Specify it 
to automatically an appropriate range of etas and lambas.}
}
\value{
A copy of the \code{SnpMatrix$map} \code{data.frame}, with the 
following additions:
\itemize{
\item{c: contains the univariate association score for every single SNP.}
\item{selected: logical vector indicating if the SNP was selected by SConES 
or not.}
\item{module: integer with the number of the module the SNP belongs to.}
}
}
\description{
Finds the SNPs maximally associated with a phenotype while being
connected in an underlying network. Select the hyperparameters by
cross-validation.
}
\examples{
gi <- get_GI_network(minigwas, snpMapping = minisnpMapping, ppi = minippi)
sigmod.cv(minigwas, gi)
sigmod.cv(minigwas, gi, score = "glm")
